# General Information

In this project we have made the frontend (with React) of an API, whose main theme is movie rental.
## Appendix

We can register as a user, log in, search for movies by title and add each movie to the rental list. We can also modify our user data. The admin will also be able to delete users.

To connect as a user, first we will go to the registry, and we will registe

<br>

The next step will be to log in to the login view

<br>

<br>

Once we are logged in, we will click on a movie, and we will have the option to rent it

By pressing the rent button, it will direct us to the view of our orders. Here it will show us all the orders of the user himself

Finally, we see the settings view. If we are admin, the admin menu will also appear, and if not, not.
